# HFD-CCA

## Overview
A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that enables direct communication between the brain and an external device, bypassing traditional neural pathways. It typically captures brain signals, processes them, and translates them into commands to control computers, prosthetics, or other devices, offering new ways for individuals to interact with technology. 
SSVEP (Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential) is a type of brain response generated when a person looks at a visual stimulus that flickers at a constant frequency, such as a flashing light or patterned display. It is commonly used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to detect which stimulus a user is focusing on, enabling control of external devices based on visual attention.
